# Image-Classification-using-Distributed-Learning
This repository contains the implementation and comparison of three machine learning paradigms: Centralized Learning, Federated Learning, and Distributed Swarm Learning. The models are trained and tested on the CIFAR-10 dataset to demonstrate their unique characteristics and performance differences.
